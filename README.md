# Myntra_Case_Study

# Problem Statement
Myntra’s current pricing, discounts, and product visibility strategies are not fully optimized for maximum sales and customer trust. Refining these strategies is critical to improving profitability, enhancing brand reliability, and ensuring stronger product positioning for sustained growth.

# Data Collection
The dataset was divided into three key segments:
* Women Table → Product Name, Brand, Price, Discount %, Rating, Verified Buyers
* Men Table → Product Name, Brand, Price, Discount %, Rating, Verified Buyers
* Kids Table → Product Name, Brand, Price, Discount %, Rating, Verified Buyers
  
# Key Insights
* Brand Trust Score: Certain brands had high customer trust but limited visibility.
* Price to Performance Ratio: Budget-friendly brands often outperformed overpriced ones in customer ratings.
* Discount Analysis: Discounts were not uniformly effective across men, women, and kids categories.
* High-Rated Products: Several products with excellent ratings and verified buyers were under-promoted, reducing their potential sales impact.
  
# Recommendations
* Optimize Brand Positioning
Increase visibility for high-trust brands.
Reevaluate the pricing strategies for overpriced brands.
* Refine Discount Strategy
Tailor discounts by category (men, women, kids) instead of applying blanket offers.
Run A/B tests to measure discount effectiveness on conversion rates.
* Promote High-Rated Products
Highlight top-rated and verified-buyer products more aggressively in campaigns.
Feature them in homepage banners, recommendations, and email marketing.
* Price-to-Performance Optimization
Strengthen budget-friendly brand visibility since they provide strong value perception.
Ensure price alignment with customer expectations to improve conversion and trust.
